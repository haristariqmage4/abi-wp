--Do not enable this theme without installing the WP plugin "Timber" or the sit will crash as it uses Twig Syntax Engine.
-- Do not put any styles in style.css. It is there just for WP. Put all styles in /assets/css/scss/customstyles.css
-- This theme uses scss. Install the plugin WP-SCSS and configure it correctly. Create a blank directory named "cache" within the wp-scss plugin directory.

-Set the homepage explicitly in the theme to a crated page. Don't leave it up to "index.php"
